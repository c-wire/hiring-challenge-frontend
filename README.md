4 - Evaluation Critera

## CHALLENGE - Simple Cocktail Search

We will be using API at [https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)

The App should be really simple, and it should consist only of one screen.

The screen has one input field where user will enter the cocktail name eg. `margarita` and then all results will be shown below.

For this search functionality we should use this call: `https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=margarita`

The screen should initially show the input field and the search button.

When user enters the cocktail name **(1**) and clicks on the search button **(2)**, there should be an indication that the search is working (loading.. text, or spinner) **(3)**

And finally, when the results arrive, we should show them below.

**Bonus points 1**

Please note that we didn’t chose any colors or fonts. This is on purpose.

If you like you can pick colors or shades of input/buttons text and adjust image to fit the design.

Also, you can re-arrange the way the results are shown in any way you think it’s best.

**Bonus points 2**

Api documentation has “Lookup a random cocktail” described.

Add another button next to the search, “Random cocktail” that will show a random cocktail instead of one that user is searching for

**Bonus points 3**

In our wireframe design we show only image of the drink, name, instruction and ingreedients.

There are couple more fields in the API that could be interesting to show here, feel free to include them, and figure out where is the best place to show them.
